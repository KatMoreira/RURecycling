HackHers 2024 Submission - RURecycling

This model is designed to determine whether an item is recycleable or trash from object detection. The distinctions between "Recycle" and "Trash" are based on the waste mangement regulations of Middlesex County, NJ -- the home of Rutgers University - New Brunswick. It is trained, validated, and tested using YOLOv5 and trained on a custom dataset, containing 1729 images, annotated using Roboflow.
